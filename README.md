Clippy is a minimal clipboard history log made with
[Electron](https://electronjs.org), [Preact](https://preactjs.com), and
[htm](https://github.com/developit/htm). It doesn't store nor sync your
clipboard. I can't showcase how badly I needed a clipboard log. I
needed one to the point of building one.

> I wrote this code in a couple hours and this was my first time using Electron, don't @ me ðŸ˜‚

> Some of my projects are available on my [projects page](https://iamnabil.netlify.app/projects).

## Features
This project is *minimal*. Features include:

- Click to copy back
- Right Click to delete from log
- Clear log (can clear system's clipboard as well)
- Clear system's clipboard only (history untouched)
- Copy images
- Open links embedded in copied text
- Copy links embedded in copied text

Yeah.. just those lol ðŸ˜‚ ~~I may add export and link rendering later on, the
groundwork is almost done so... _maybe_. ðŸ¤·~~ Added link rendering!

## Getting Started

### Developing
Just start the development server using the `dev` command. Voila!

### Building
You can build from source using the `make` command. Requires NodeJS and NPM,
just in case.

## Why Electron?
Why not? I'm a frontend developer and work with JavaScript all the time, so this
was the easiest option available to me!

## Why Preact?
I was lazy and made this in a couple iterations over a few hours, so I didn't
want to build the DOM logic all over again.

## Why not React?
I may port the code to some other
project and don't wish to take the large size with me. Was a nice experiment as well.

## What the hell is `htm`?
`htm` is a JSX alternative using standard tagged templates. It basically allows
you to write JSX-like code without babel!

## Feature Requests & Bug Reports
Feel free to do either or both! Everyone's welcome!
