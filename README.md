Clippy is a minimal clipboard history log made with
[Electron](https://electronjs.org), [Preact](https://preactjs.com), and
[htm](https://github.com/developit/htm). It doesn't store nor sync your
clipboard. I can't showcase how badly I needed a clipboard log. I
needed one to the point of building one.

> Some of my projects are available on my [projects page](https://iamnabil.netlify.app/projects).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Versioning

To bump the package version use `npm version` as found in the NPM
[documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-version). I recommend
using a signed commit message as well by running `npm version patch -s -m
"chore(release) %s"`.


### How do I use search?

You can be specific about what you want to search, typing:

- `image: png` to search for PNG images

- `image: jpeg` to search for JPEG images

- `image: <any valid image MIME subtype>` to search for other formats

- `text: <some text>` to search for text

Or just type text directly!

> See MIME types for images [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#image_types)

## Building From Source

If you'd like to use a custom build from a specific commit do the following:

1. `git clone https://github.com/KL13NT/clippy.git`
2. `cd clippy`
3. `git checkout <commit hash>` without the `<>`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run make`

Make sure to have git, nodejs, and npm installed locally. Note that all commits on master build successfully, so you won't need to change
anything.

## Getting Started

This project uses `electron-forge` under the hood, allowing us to develop,
build, and publish our Electron app with simple commands.

We use [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen) to manage the contribution flow.

When committing we use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit`. This initiates
commitizen and starts its interactive cli to create commit messages that follow
the guidelines. The commit is then linted by
[commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to make sure
it follows the [Angular Commit Message
Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).
For the reasoning behind this see issue [#39](https://github.com/KL13NT/clippy/issues/39).

> If you're an advanced user you may use `git commit` directly as long as your
> commits follow the guidelines.

> Make sure to [sign](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification) your commits. This guarantees ownership of your contributions.

To developer or build locally you first need to install the dependencies. We use
_npm_ for this.

```
npm install
```

### Developing

In development, the electron-forge dev command is used to start the application
in development mode.

```
npm run dev
```

### Building

You can build from source using the `make` command. Building for a target OS requires
that respective OS. You probably won't need to run this unless you're on the
core team.

```
npm run make
```
